      "content": "The Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) has appointed current finance chief Boitumelo Mosako as its new CEO and its first black woman to lead the bank. Mosako will succeed Patrick Dlamini whose term ends next month, having held the role of CEO for more than a decade. During his tenure, he delivered “stability, strength, and sustainable growth to the bank, and the country,” the DBSA said in a statement. The bank said it had received approval from its shareholder, the government through the finance minister, to appoint Mosako, who was identified by the bank’s board from a pool of candidates. The CEO of the DBSA is appointed through a process initiated by its board. It makes a recommendation to the Minister of Finance, who grants the approvals for CEO appointments. Chair of the DBSA, Mark Swilling, said the recommendation of the first black woman as CEO is admirable, and a great feat for the bank. “… We are proud that this move happened from within the bank. It is a testament to the strength of the institution, as a sanctuary for development practitioners, and we will rally behind her as she assumes her new role and meets all its critical demands,” Swilling said. The bank added that Mosako has played a critical role in propelling the institution to new heights in her CFO role. “Following cabinet’s approval of the recommendation to appoint her, the board will, with oversight from the shareholder, manage the appointment and assumption of office,” it said. Speaking on Dlamini’s time at the bank, Swilling said: “The conviction with which he led the bank over the last decade, and the institutional credibility he assisted is one for the books. And indeed, he did not do this alone, it was all possible with the support of a capable team of executives, divisional heads, managers, practitioners and experts, and administration.” The DBSA said the appointment process will be finalised over the coming weeks.",

      "content": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has directed Deposit Money Banks to collect old N500 and N1,000 notes from customers, according to a report by Vanguard. This implies that Nigerians can now deposit their old notes in banks as opposed to taking them only to CBN offices. According to Vanguard, a top CBN official confirmed the development, saying, “yes we have directed them to collect the old N500 and N1000 from customers.” Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that the old N500 and N1,000 notes are no longer legal tenders but those having the notes should take the notes to the CBN so as not to lose their money. Consequently, the CBN opened a portal for people with the old N500 and N1,000 notes to register how much they want to deposit and to get a reference code to confirm there registration. The reference code will be used to deposit the old notes at any of the CBN offices across the country. However, as thousands of Nigerians flooded CBN offices, the bank reportedly opted to allow banks to collect the old notes from their customers. Vanguard quoted a top bank official and branch head to have said that his branch will collect old notes from customers tomorrow, Saturday, as the branch did not open to customers today, Friday, due to fear of attack.

      "content": "Residents have had sleepless nights due to a loud noise coming from a nearby harbour. People living in Mile Oak and parts of Portslade have said they have been disturbed by a mystery noise coming from Shoreham Port over several nights. Councillor Peter Atkinson, independent councillor for North Portslade, said he has been “inundated with emails and messages” from residents being kept awake by a sound coming from a ship moored at the harbour. He said: “I’ve had countless complaints from residents. It has been making this horrible noise now for the third day running. “It is very loud in Mile Oak which must be something to do with the way the land lies and the prevailing winds.” Cllr Atkinson also said he had heard that residents in Portslade have been bothered by the noise for at least seven nights. READ MORE: New five-mile A259 seafront cycle lane could link Hove and Shoreham Shoreham Port confirmed that the noise was coming from a boat unloading at a private terminal, over which it has no authority. A spokeswoman for Shoreham Port said they take noise complaints seriously and they “strive to be a good neighbour” to those who live nearby. She said: “We are aware of a noise in the port area this week, which appears to be emanating from a discharging vessel on a private terminal that is not owned or operated by Shoreham Port. “As the wharf is privately owned, we have no authority regarding their operations or operating times, much the same as other private wharves locally. “However, we are concerned with the impact the operations are having on the local community and have expressed this concern to the private operator. “As we understand it, the discharge is currently due to be completed later on today, with the vessel sailing this evening.” A spokesman for Adur District Council said that damp weather has exacerbated the noise, as cold air trapped below warm air amplifies sound. He said: “It appears the source is from a ship unloading cement, which we are advised usually takes place every three to four weeks with minimal impact. “The damp weather also halted work intermittently, leading to delays, although they hope to complete the project later today or tomorrow morning. “Moving forward, we will seek assurances that any future noise impact can be greatly reduced. We apologise to anyone who has been affected.”",

      "content": "South African lender Absa expects to report a double-digit rise in earnings for its 2022 financial year, despite Ghana’s sovereign debt crisis weighing on its performance. The big six bank said it will report a 10% to 15% increase in headline earnings per share (Heps) to between 2 362 cents and 2 469 cents per share, compared to the previous reporting year. Read the full Sens announcement . According to the bank, earnings per share would climb between 12% to 18% to reach between 2 396 cents and 2 525 cents per share, the bank said in a voluntary trading statement for the year to end December 2022. “Excluding the impairment charges on Ghana sovereign-related exposures, our normalised Heps for 2022 is expected to increase by more than 20%,” Absa said. The banking group managed to increase profits in the face of its exposure to Ghana which is currently contending with major sovereign debt struggles. The overly indebted west African nation has been facing increased economic pressure and has missed large payments on its Eurobonds and commercial loans. Last year, Ghana’s Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, its government’s plan to undertake a debt operation programme, the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP) to give it time to bring its debt to sustainable levels by way of exchanging existing domestic bonds for a set of four with maturation dates of 2027, 2029, 2032 and 2037. The debt exchange plans would see 137.3 billion Ghanaian cedis or over R202 billion in local bonds exchanged for new ones, its finance ministry said in a . As a result, Absa said it expects an uptick in credit impairments on Friday. “With greater certainty on the terms of the proposed debt exchange programme with the Ghana sovereign, we expect our credit impairments to increase significantly year-on-year, mainly due to impairments on sovereign investment securities and related exposures in the banking book,” Absa said. The bank said interest income growth, boosted in part by a recovery in life insurance revenue, has led to an increase by mid-teens in group revenue. On the other hand, it expects pre-provision profit growth in the mid-20s, helped by a single-digit growth in the bank’s operating expenses. “Consequently, our 2022 cost-to-income ratio is expected to improve noticeably to the low 50s, in line with the first half 2022 ratio,” the bank said. Its credit loss ratio for the reporting period is expected to be similar to the first half charge of 91 basis points when excluding Ghana sovereign-related charges, Absa said.",

      "description": "Asylum seekers who do not renew their visas within one month of the date of expiry are considered to have abandoned their asylum applications, according to the act.",
      "content": "The Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town has won a significant victory against the Minister of Home Affairs in the Western Cape High Court, which has declared sections of the Refugees Act unconstitutional. The sections in question provide that asylum seekers who have not renewed their visas within one month of the date of expiry are considered to have abandoned their asylum applications. This, Scalabrini argued in its application before Deputy Judge President Patricia Goliath, meant that delinquent asylum seekers were considered to be undocumented, treated as “illegal foreigners”, without access to jobs and social services, and faced deportation. Scalabrini launched a constitutional challenge against two sections of the Refugees Act as well as parts of the act’s regulations. In her ruling this week, Judge Goliath deemed these sections and regulations unconstitutional. This ruling, however, will still have to be ratified by the Constitutional Court. Scalabrini’s core mandate is to assist and safeguard immigrants and displaced communities, including asylum seekers and refugees. It is also a member of the Consortium for Refugees and Migrants South Africa (CoRMSA) which comprises 26 organisations with similar objectives. Scalabrini previously obtained an interdict against the Minister, suspending the implementation of the relevant sections of the Act and the regulation, pending the outcome of the constitutional challenge which then was heard by Judge Goliath. The organisation argued that those who did not reapply within the legislated time-frame were deemed undocumented. Even though they had a valid refugee claim, they could be sent back to their countries where they may face persecution, death, torture, sexual violence and other threats. It said that Home Affairs officials had a duty to ensure that people are given a reasonable opportunity to apply for a visa. This, it was argued, violated the right to non-refoulement (a fundamental principle of international law which forbids a country receiving asylum seekers from returning them to a country in which they would be likely to be in danger of persecution). CoRMSA, admitted as an amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the matter, made submissions about the impact of “abandonment rules” on asylum seekers, particularly their children and ability to protect themselves. The consortium said the provisions in the Act were counter to the protective goals and purpose of domestic and international refugee law. Judge Goliath said the minister acknowledged that the abandonment provisions violated the constitution, but argued that they were rational and justifiable due to the fact that asylum seekers behaved in a recalcitrant manner and failed to renew their visas in good time. This created backlogs and imposed an administrative burden on the department. It was not disputed that it took on average, five years for asylum seekers to be recognised as refugees, and therefore had to renew their visas between 10 and 20 times in that period. “Asylum seekers are permitted to work, study, and use social services … Without a valid permit, they, as well as their children, become vulnerable to deportation.” Judge Goliath said the essence of the minister’s argument was that most asylum seekers are not genuine and use the process to “avoid meeting the requirements of immigration laws”. The abandonment provisions incentivised them to finalise their applications. Judge Goliath said, however, that the provisions were certainly not in the best interests of affected children, as was required by law and international conventions and charters. “The provisions take effect automatically after the expiry of 30 days with no individualised regard to the impact of affected children,” she said. “The mere fact that representations can be made to the standing committee, after the fact, once a child is already rendered undocumented for extended periods is of no use or assistance. This is aggravated by the absence of formal procedures to make representations, let alone any procedure to ensure that the voices of the children are heard.” She said South Africa is obliged to establish systems and allocate resources to ensure “the international human rights law protection of refugees and asylum seekers”. She said the provisions were clearly arbitrary because asylum seekers would no longer be deported based on the merits of their claims, but on external circumstances, such as the nearest Refugee Centre, the length of the queue there and the workload of Home Affairs officials. “At the heart of [the minister’s] justification is an unlawful presumption and prejudgment that most asylum seekers have no valid claims and no interest in pursuing these claims. This violates the core principle of refugee law that asylum seekers must be treated as presumptive refugees, with all the protections this entails, until the merits of their claims have been finally determined through a proper process. “The right to non-refoulement is of great importance in the overall constitutional scheme as it recognises human beings’ right to dignity.” Judge Goliath directed that the legislation be amended to rectify the defect and that the minister pay Scalabrini’s legal costs. © 2023 GroundUp.
